# Assembly_Simplified_Literally
A temporary remedy for perpetual discomfort (ASSEMBLY Language).
**Note:** So, the code's a mess—intentionally (not rly), of course. It's as robust as a house of cards, about as efficient as a tortoise in a marathon, and redundant enough to make your eyes roll. But hey, despite my burning hatred for this language, I figured it might just be the ticket for fellow sufferers like yourself. Consider it a toolkit of sorts, tailor-made for university students—because who needs clarity and elegance when you've got convoluted code, isn't that right patrick?
